This code example is part of a tutorial on CSharp Delegates
Please find the relevant tutorial at this location, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jABhPwEfA-I&lc=UgwmqSpc8z0An7NSWVl4AaABAg
If you download this project and run it you'll get an exception (this is because you'll need to run relevant migration commands to first build the SQLite database)
Once you have run the relvant migration commands, the code will run as expected
Please go through the tutorial first before running the code
I explain how to run the relevant migration commands at around the 13:54 mark.
