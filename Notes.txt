CommonFieldValidatorFunctions.cs

Delegate is a strongly typed function call as it points to a class method of the same signature.

In CommonFieldValidatorFunctions.cs:
	Deletgates are declared in the namespace
	Private static properties created and assigned null on creation
	Private Method declared with delegate return and parameters form ie signature
	Public property created and assigned the private static property which has a delegate contructed with the private method


	namespace....
		delegate type T declaration return type name (parms [,...]);
			class C...
				private property  _p set to type T and initialized as null

				private method xx in class C declared with appropriate return of delegate T

				public property P of type T with getter assigning it the delegate type T constructed with method xx


				delegate T => static C._p -> (static C.P -> static C.xx)
